                                Biochar not only removes carbon from the atmosphere, but also creates a valuable material for agriculture, the built environment, and other uses. Biochar is a fine-grained, highly porous material that is made from biomass such as agriculture byproducts, forestry residues, and solid waste (sewage sludge). Biochar is made by high-heat, low-oxygen processes, i.e. pyrolysis or gasification.</p>

                                Turning agricultural residues into biochar reduces the need for farmers to burn residues, while also creating a valuable soil amendment that can improve soil, reduce water usage, lower methane emissions, and save on input costs for expensive and polluting chemical fertilizers.</p>
